# Spec Context (spec-kit)

Primary source of truth:
- `.specify/` (spec-kit artifacts)
- `specs/` (user-facing requirements/specs)

Instructions for agents:
- Treat spec as authoritative.
- If code conflicts with spec, flag as SPEC DRIFT with file+line references.
- Prefer minimal changes that restore compliance.
